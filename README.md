# Getting started

To start the website please write the following to your terminal:

1. cd backend 
2. npm install
3. node server.js



## Scope of the project

The aim of the project was to build a website with server side included, where users can upload their favourite pictures. 

The image gallery was built with vanilla JavaScript and styled with CSS. I have used Express.js to build the server side of the project.
